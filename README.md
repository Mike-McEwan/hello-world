# hello-world
The objective of this project is to achieve general use of a new cryptocurrency used only for exchange of value between members of a limited group. I have designed and implemented a training course to improve a person's teamworking capability, and have made it open suorce, in that the materials and techniques are free to those who want to use them. It requires people from several different disciplines to deliver the training - the cryptocurrency would be used to pay each other. The only real world cash involved is when whoever arranges the training wkith a client gets paid by that client.
